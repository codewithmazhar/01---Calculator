Simple Calculator with Python and PyQt6

Welcome to the Simple Calculator project! This project not only provides you with a basic calculator for performing arithmetic calculations but also serves as a hands-on introduction to basic GUI desktop development with Python and PyQt6. In this project, you will be using PyQt6, QtWidgets, and more.
Features

Calculator Functionality: You can perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, using this calculator.

•	Clear and Back Feature: There are buttons to clear the current input or go back to correct mistakes.

•	Ans Feature: You can use the "Ans" button to include the previous answer in your calculations.

Learning Objectives

By working with this project, you will gain experience and understanding in the following areas:

Intro to Desktop App Development with PyQt6

PyQt6 is a Python library that allows you to create desktop applications with graphical user interfaces. In this project, you'll get hands-on experience with PyQt5's key concepts, including:

•	Widgets: You'll learn how to create and use various widgets such as buttons, line edits, and layouts.

•	Signals and Slots: Understand how to connect user interactions (signals) to your custom functions (slots).

•	CSS Styling: You'll explore how to style your graphical user interface with CSS.

Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Python and PyQt6 installed. You can install PyQt6 using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5
   ```

3. Open the project in your preferred Python IDE or code editor.

4. Explore the code to understand how the GUI elements are created and how the calculator logic is implemented.

5. Experiment and modify the code to enhance your understanding of PyQt6 and GUI development.

Contributions

Feel free to contribute to this project by improving the calculator, adding new features, or enhancing the user interface. Learning by doing is one of the best ways to master GUI development with Python and PyQt6.

I hope you find this project educational and enjoyable. Happy coding!
